# Don’t Look At Me!

No, really. I’m a mess. This is a little idea I had so I could have a nice
bootstrapped Tornado app ready for random ideas. I made this out of a bunch of 
spare parts I had laying around.

The plan is to add:

* The ability to create an app by running a command and an app name, replacing
Warm Air everywhere with the new app name.

Anyway, feel free to poke around, but it’s a bit of a mess.
